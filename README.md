# Game of Life
Since John Conway passed away recently, I took some time on the public holiday to implement the famous Game of Life. Probably not beautiful and by no means a good example (it lacks tests), but it works.

To test it on your own machine, run:
```bash
npm run build
```
and open the index.html in a browser of your choosing.


A default configuration is given in the code and should display five switching blocks.
